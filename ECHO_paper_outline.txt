ECHO Paper Outline:

1.	Introduction
   -  21cm cosmology bit
   -  HERA?
   -	Primary beam response needed for:
      -	Foreground subtraction - need to know low elevation angle response

2.	Design and Method
   -	Experimental setup
      -	3DR X8 octoquad drone
         -	Preprogram flight path using internal GPS
      -	Valon 5007 dual frequency synthesizer
         -	137.5-4400 MHz
      -	BicoLOG 30100 biconical antenna
         -  30 MHz to 1 GHz
      -	Signal Hound BB60A Spectrum Analyzer
         -	9 kHz to 6 GHz
   -	Drone flown in spiral pattern along hemisphere centered on antenna under test
   -	ROI for fixed transmitter polarization
   -	ECHO pipeline generates beam map
   -	Uses Healpix and Healpy (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005ApJ...622..759G&db_key=AST&high=41069202cf02947)
   -	FITS output

3.	Calibration
   -  NRAO, Green Bank Orbcomm reference dipoles testing site
      - Each of the N/S reference antennae contains:
         -  Two dipoles polarized NS/EW, respectively
         -  2m x 2m ground screen
         -  See Neben et al. (2015) for full description
   -  Flew four runs with NS/EW polarization for each dipole
   -  Test of ECHO system

   3.1	Maps
      -  Plots for Nant and Sant all dipoles/polarizations (2 x 2 plot for each antenna)

   3.2	Comparison to Orbcomm Ratio Maps
      -	Neben et al. (2015): http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015RS005678/abstract;jsessionid=69E36DF7FB2063E5E41A017BDC65A0EE.f02t02
      -  Modeling in CST gives beam for reference antennae
      -  Ratio plot of our beam to Abraham's beam
         -  Get Abraham's beams?

4.	MWA Tile
   -  Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University MWA tile used as auxiliary test
      -  Beam plot with zenith pointing

   4.1	Data
      -  Waypoint data flagged
         -  Plot with and without waypoint filtering?

   4.2	Systematic Variation
      -

   4.3	Comparison to Orbcomm Maps
      -

5.	Conclusion
